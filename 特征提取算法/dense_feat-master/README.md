# Dense Feature
In this package, you find MATLAB code for extracting dense Color Histogram and dense SIFT feature from a given image. 

## Remarks
- The core function (sp_dense_sift.m) comes from Scenes/Objects classification toolbox http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/29800-scenesobjects-classification-toolbox
- The core function (sp_dense_color.m) is a modified MATLAB version of the denseCOLOR.cpp in the toolbox without loss of computation efficiency. 
- These low-level visual features are used in our recent research works  [salience_reid](https://github.com/Robert0812/salience_reid), and [salience_match](https://github.com/Robert0812/salience_match). 

## Acknowledgement
- [Sebastien Paris](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/authors/13308)'s submission in MATLAB FileExchange inspired this package.
