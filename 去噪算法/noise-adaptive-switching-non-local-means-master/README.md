# Noise Adaptive Switching Non-Local Means(NASNLM)
Aiming at the removal of salt-and-pepper noise, a noise adaptive switching non-local means denoising algorithm (NASNLM) is proposed in this program. For noise detection, the pixels of image are divided into the noise and the non-noise points. For filtering, four different filtering techniques are adopted: switching filtering, noise adaptive median filtering, edge-perserving filtering and non-local means filtering. Switching filtering can keep the gray-value of non-noise points unchanged. Noise adaptive median filtering can suppress the high-density salt-and-pepper noise. Edge-preserving filtering can preserve more image edges and details. Non-local means filtering can further improve the ability of noise suppression and detail maintenance. Experiments demonstrate that for removal of the high-density salt-and-pepper noise by NASNLM algorithm, a better denoising effect is obtained than other methods.
